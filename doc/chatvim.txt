Section 1: Usage                                   *ChatVimUsage*

This plugin allows you to talk with LLMs in neovim. Start lines
with ">" and then type `<leader>g` and then the plugin will query
llm_model with the chat in the current buffer using "LLM:" and ">" as
cues for who said what. The plugin will insert LLM's response into
the next line prepended with "LLM: ". Change the model you're
talking to by setting the g:chatvim_model variable to the model you
use by setting `g:llm_model`. The default model is
"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620".

====================================================================
Section 2: Mappings                                   *ChatVimUsage*

							*<leader>g*
<leader>g       Calls an LLM and inserts response into next line
