Section 1: Usage                                   *ChatVimUsage*

This plugin allows you to talk with ChatGPT in neovim. Start lines
with ">" and then type "??" or ".." and then the plugin will query
chatgpt with the chat in the current buffer using "GPT:" and ">" as
cues for who said what. The plugin will insert GPT's response into
the next line prepended with "GPT: ". If you want to start a chat in
the middle of the file you can start a new chat with ">>" and the
plugin only reads up until the line where it was called.

====================================================================
